300 Sets of High Resolution and Low Resolution Tissue Pictures for Deep Learning

This data set is consisted of 300 sets of microscopic images of tissues. For each set, a high-resolution image and a low-resolution image are matched. The pictures are then all converted to csv format by compiling each picture to rows and each pixel of red, green and blue channels to columns. This data set is potentially capable of building up training and testing sets for deep learning. 

Given that this data set is completely open-source and free of charge, please cite the contributor while using the data set for commercial or academic purposes. If any problem occurs while the data set is being used, please contact wag001@ucsd.edu for help.

Even though the original pictures in the data set is acquired by a internet crawler algorithm attached to the repository which automatically downloads open-source pictures, we would like to sincerely thank contributors of these images.

This data set is affiliated to a deep-learning-super-resolution project of Dept of Chemistry, School of Science, University of Tokyo.
